# 💳 Credit Risk Prediction

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a **loan applicant is likely to default** based on various features such as loan amount, education, and income.
It is part of a machine learning task that covers **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Handle missing data appropriately.
* Visualize key features to understand patterns and relationships.
* Train a **binary classification model** such as Logistic Regression or Decision Tree.
* Evaluate the model using **accuracy** and a **confusion matrix**.

## 📂 Dataset

* **Name:** Loan Prediction Dataset
* **Source:** Available on Kaggle.
* **Description:** Includes details of loan applicants such as:

  * Loan Amount
  * Applicant Income & Co-Applicant Income
  * Education Level
  * Employment Status
  * Credit History
  * Loan Approval Status (Target Variable)

## 📜 Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**

   * Loaded dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
   * Checked dataset structure and identified missing values.

2. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handled missing values using appropriate strategies (mean, median, mode, or categorical imputation).
   * Converted categorical variables into numerical form.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Visualized **Loan Amount**, **Education**, and **Income** distributions.
   * Compared feature trends between defaulted and non-defaulted applicants.

4. **Model Training**

   * Selected models: Logistic Regression / Decision Tree Classifier.
   * Split dataset into **training** and **testing** sets.

5. **Model Evaluation**

   * Calculated **accuracy** score.
   * Plotted **confusion matrix** to analyze predictions.
